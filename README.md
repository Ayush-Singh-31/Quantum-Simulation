## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

### `notebooks/`
Contains detailed Jupyter Notebooks covering key topics in quantum computing:
- **Bra-Ket Notation**: Representation of quantum states and operations using Dirac notation.
- **Tensor Product and Kronecker Product**: Mathematical foundations and their applications in quantum systems.
- **Single Qubit States**: Representation, visualization, and manipulation of individual qubits.
- **Multi-Qubit Systems**: Analysis of entangled states and multi-qubit operations.
- **Quantum Gates**: Implementation and effects of standard quantum gates (e.g., Pauli gates, Hadamard, CNOT).

### `scripts/`
Standalone Python scripts for:
- Quantum gate simulations.
- State vector operations.
- Custom utility functions for quantum computing.

### `resources/`
Supplementary material, including:
- References to textbooks and research papers.
- Links to online resources and documentation for quantum computing frameworks.
